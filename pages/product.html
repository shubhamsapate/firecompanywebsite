                A fire alarm system has a number of devices working together to detect and warn people through visual
                and audio appliances when smoke, fire, carbon monoxide or other emergencies are present. These alarms
                may be activated automatically from smoke detectors, and heat detectors or may also be activated via
                manual fire alarm activation devices such as manual call points or pull stations.

                A fire hydrant, also called a fireplug, fire pump, johnny pump, or simply pump, is a connection point by
                which firefighters can tap into a water supply. It is a component of active fire protection.

                A master valve is an automatic valve, typically an electric solenoid type valve, that is installed at
                the point where the irrigation system connects to the water supply. The master valve is wired to a
                special "master valve circuit" on the irrigation controller. (Sometimes this circuit is called a "pump
                start circuit".

                A fire extinguisher is an active fire protection device used to extinguish or control small fires, often
                in emergency situations. It is not intended for use on an out-of-control fire, such as one which has
                reached the ceiling, endangers the user (i.e., no escape route, smoke, explosion hazard, etc.), or
                otherwise requires the expertise of a fire brigade. Typically, a fire extinguisher consists of a
                hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent which can be discharged to extinguish a fire.
                Fire extinguishers manufactured with non-cylindrical pressure vessels also exist but are less common.
